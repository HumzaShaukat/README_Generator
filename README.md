# README_Generator

## Description

This is a CLI program that asks you a series of questions and generates a functional README.md file.  This program utilizes node.js and the fs and inquirer modules.

## Usage 

Navigate to the the assets folder and run the program using

```
node index.js
```

After answering all the prompts, a new README.md file will be uploaded into the util folder and will contain all the information you entered into the prompt.  If you included one of the available licenses, there will be a badge included on the readme as well.
